# BaseConversionAlgorithm
This repository provides a C++ implementation of a direct base-to-base conversion algorithm supporting arbitrary bases from 2 to 62. The algorithm converts numbers directly from source base \(B_1\) to target base \(B_2\) without intermediate decimal conversion, maintaining exact precision for both integer and fractional parts using integer-only array-based arithmetic. **The core method can be extended to support base 2 input to any target base.** See the accompanying paper for full theoretical details and extension possibilities.
